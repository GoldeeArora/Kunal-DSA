// One of the most important topic of DSA


                   // What is binary Search

// optimised way to make a search 
// It can search in a sorted array(ascending array or descending array )
// Time complexity is O(logn)

                        // Algo of Binary Search

// take the middle element[m](say) of the array and compare it to the target 
// and take the other array from  the m and target
// now take m as the middle of the new array

//  We can perform this because the array is sorted
// For the time complexity explanation go through the kunal kushwaha notes
// and for the example as well
